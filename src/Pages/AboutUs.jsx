          Eagles inspire us with their powerful vision. Being dauntless and tenacious, they aim and soar high in the sky. The crest draws parallels between Newleaf and the eagle, the symbol of transcendence. Newleaf, like the eagle, has rejuvenated itself to nurture the educands well and soar higher with changing times.
